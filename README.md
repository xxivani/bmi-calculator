### Expected behaviour

Below you will find the BMI ranges and their weight classifications. Based on the person's BMI results, add their weight classification onto sentence "Your BMI suggests youâ€™re" within the results component.

- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI 30 or greater

Add the individual's healthy weight range based on the lower and upper BMI categorisations and the person's height.
